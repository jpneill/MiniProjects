Trying to be more organised with my projects. These will be small programs designed and coded in a few hours looking at simple GUIs, Games, Simulations, problem solving.

-Tic Tac Toe
A simple 2-player tic tac toe game based off a tutorial found at sdltutorials.com.
To play players take simply click an empty cell on the grid to place either an X or an O.

Changed the code from the original source to check for a win condition.
Next update will be a change to include a very basic AI for a single player vs computer mode.
