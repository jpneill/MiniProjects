Trying to be more organised with my projects. These will be small programs designed and coded in a few hours looking at simple GUIs, Games, Simulations, problem solving.

***CPP Projects***
-**Tic Tac Toe**
A simple 2-player tic tac toe game based off a tutorial found at sdltutorials.com.
To play players click an empty cell on the grid to place either an X or an O.

Changed the code from the original source to check for a win condition.
Next update will be a change to include a very basic AI for a single player vs computer mode.

***CS Projects***
-**Sand Waves**
A console application that simulates the formation of aeolian sand ripples.
The initial configuration is a random array representing different sized piles of sand.
The simulation then uses cellular automata to simulate the alteration of sand grain positions by the wind.
